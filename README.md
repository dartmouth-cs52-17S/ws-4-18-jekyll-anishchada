# jekyll Workshop!

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator that automates a lot of the site creation progress. It's popular for personal and blogging sites.
## Installation

### Mac
1. Your computer probably comes with Ruby installed! You can verify this with which ruby. If you don't get a path returned, you can easily install ruby with Homebrew. If you plan on doing more serious development with Ruby, you should look into an environment manager, like rbenv, but that's beyond the scope of this workshop.
2. Now you need to be able to install "gems", which are Ruby packages. RubyGems is the Ruby standard for publishing and managing third party libraries. If you installed Ruby with Homebrew or an environment manager, RubyGems should be installed by default. Check if you have gems installed by running the which gem command. If you don't get a path returned, you can download RubyGems here.
3. Last step: it's time to install some gems specific to Jekyll. To do this, simple execute gem install jekyll bundler. If you didn't install Ruby with homebrew or rbenv, you may have to run sudo gem install jekyll bundler.

### Presentation Section

~(10-15 minutes)

* motivate the technology

* show some use cases
* discuss pros/cons

You may use any presentation technology, although [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) is particularly fitting as an open source javascript library, and supports code blocks. :gem:

Your written tutorial document will be a walkthrough of building something using the specific web technologies.

It should include:

* Overview of what will be attempted
